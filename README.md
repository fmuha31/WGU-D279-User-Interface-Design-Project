# WGU-D279-User-Interface-Design-Assessment
Hello! I'm Fatir, a Software Engineering major at WGU. This repository contains my User Interface Design Assessment project.

## Creator
**Fatir Muhammad**

## Overview
This repository contains my submission for the **User Interface Design** assessment (D279) at Western Governors University (WGU). The project is a UI/UX design solution for **Paradigm Pet Professionals**, a company that provides virtual consultations to pet owners. The current website is outdated and does not meet user or stakeholder needs.

As a newly hired UI/UX Designer at Synesthor (an IT services firm contracted by Paradigm Pet Professionals), my role was to evaluate the existing website and redesign it with a focus on improved usability, accessibility, and responsiveness.

## Project Scenario

Paradigm Pet Professionals' current website was developed over a decade ago by an intern. The goal of this project is to redevelop the site into a responsive, user-centered experience that better serves its audienceâ€”primarily new and prospective pet owners in the U.S.
